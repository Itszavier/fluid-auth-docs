**Provider Name:** `github`

The GitHub Provider in FluidAuth Express simplifies integrating GitHub authentication into your application. With this provider, users can log in using their GitHub account, allowing for a seamless and familiar authentication experience

Use the name `github` when configuring this provider in your AuthService instance. For example:

```ts
authService.authenticate("github");
```


**Usage:**

To use the GitHub Provider, import it into your application as follows:

```js

const { GithubProvider } = require("@fluidauth/express/providers");

export const Github = new GithubProvider({
  credential: {
    clientId: "your-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
    redirectUri: "your-redirect-uri",
  },

  async verifyUser(data, profile) {
    return { user: null, info: "no user in the database" };
  }
});
```

### Steps to Obtain Client ID, Client Secret, and Setup Redirect URL

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App:**
   - Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com).
   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
   - Click **"New OAuth App"**.
   - Enter the **Application Name**, **Homepage URL**, and **Authorization Callback URL**.
   - Click **"Register application"**.

2. **Obtain Client ID and Client Secret:**
   - After registration, youâ€™ll be on the application details page.
   - Find the **Client ID** at the top of the page.
   - Click **"Generate a new client secret"** to get your **Client Secret**. Keep this value secure.

3. **Configure Your Application:**
   - Update the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `redirectUri` in the GitHub Provider configuration as shown above.

For more details, refer to the [GitHub OAuth Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps) and [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
